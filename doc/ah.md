## History of Abstraction Hierarchies 

Let's look at how modern day usage of "abstraction" in linguistics and computer science has come into existence, from an anthropological perspective.

A systematic method of building a taxonomy of conceivable concepts was utilized by: 

- [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato#Philosophy) (around 400 BC), in creating a "theory of 'forms'"

- [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle#Theoretical_philosophy) (around 335 BC), in using a dialectical style of reasoning for making judgments about values of discernible things 

- [Pāṇini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini#Legacy) (most likely around 400 - 350 BC), in producing a rigorous set of rules for composing phonemes or root words, to create compound words via "generative grammar" in Sanskrit language 

- Kong Fuzi or Confucius (see, [Hundred Schools of Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Schools_of_Thought), which existed for quite a few centuries around 500 BC), in describing the basis of zeal, virtues, and "accurate perceptions" 

<br>

Scholars and philosophers throughout the ages, have directly used or borrowed from, the formal analytical methods developed by various ancient masters who lived 2,500 years ago, and whose schools became popular among several different civilizations. The above-mentioned names are only a few of the more notable ones, who are still popular in current day and age. 

Ancient philosophies and living circumstances that gave rise to the humanities, arts and sciences, can be traced through archaeology of various civilizations dating as early as Bronze Age period. Perhaps human history dating earlier than 3,000 years is more fragmented and nebulous, because archaeological evidence of how life was supposed to be like, in those days, is less well-preserved than fossils from millions of years ago. 

From more well-preserved evidence of human history, it appears that people from all generations across every civilization, have constantly jostled with ways of describing and discussing, the continuum between the immediately tangible "material world", and the seemingly intangible world of "pure" ideas or ideals. 

### Part-vs-Whole Relationships Among Words 

So, a common way of describing things via their relative size and location, or in terms of inclusion of one thing within another as a constituent, has come to be known as: 

- [Mereology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mereology#History) in philosophy and in mathematics of first-order logic.

    - [Meronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meronomy), which describes the formal rules for discovering how something is or isn't, a part of something else, including itself.


### Abstract-vs-Tangible Relationships Among Words

Another common way to talk about the meaning of a word and for describing things, is to express whether a thing is ["abstract" or "concrete."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_and_concrete) 

However, it just so happens that anything that may seem abstract and generic to one person, may seem rather tangible and specific to another. The specificity of any word, phrase, or a sentence, in terms of its meaning and usage, is naturally dependent on cultural and ecological factors prevalent during a conversation between a group of people. Furthermore, via published materials, "a conversation" can span a vast diaspora of people over the globe, across decades or even centuries of years in time. 

As such, describing the extent to which a concept or an idea is tangible or not, is in itself, a chore that requires abstract thinking and analytical aptitude. So to simplify that chore, one can use: 

- a self-centric perspective where a person describes things that are tangible and understandable to themselves;

- an anthropocentric perspective where people describe things that are tangible, understandable, and communicable among human beings or human-like beings; 

- a non-anthropocentric perspective that does not involve things pertaining to any one human being, and not even to any group of people based on anthropology or ancestry. 

Among available perspectives, the non-anthropocentric one is almost always restricted to topics like "pure math" and "theoretical physics", practitioners of which, conveniently neglect the fact that any type of humanities, mathematics, or physical sciences appreciable by human beings, would naturally be constrained by human ecology, sociology, psychology, and physiology. 

Now, all of those things are supposedly constrained by phenomena existent within pure "spirituality", which many people like to call "meta-physics." 

Meta-physic is often explained as the so-called "true reality", which is devoid of all falsehoods and anything "bad." It is supposedly immaculate, is unchanging and unerring, and is inaccessible to all things that are "profane." The rest of B-grade reality, which is available to mere mortals, is somehow illusory, deceptive, and full of machinations that cause pain and suffering to those who have yet to transcend, the "superficial reality", of mortal existence. 

Additionally, according to various mythologies, there is a much worse version of reality where destruction of meaning, as well as pain and suffering, are the only types of things that can be experienced by it inhabitants. That place is typically known as purgatory or hell. Does it *actually* exist?

Well, would you be surprised if the current universe, world, domain, or realm, that you are living in, happens to be the one where you had to "abandon all hope at its threshold", before entering into it? Would it be odd, or strange, for you to learn that the ultimate tragedy and ploy of this realm, is for you to never be able to realize what "true hope" is, because the only thing feasible in this realm is "false hope", along with the inability to ever truly figure out the difference between genuine hope versus false hope. Hope for what, you ask? Hope for anything whatsoever. 

You can be assured that if you are reading this, you are still within the world where profanities abound in and around you. But, there might still be a way to attain "transcendence", even if this is, in fact, the world where true hope cannot exist. That possible, and only way to exit this world forever, could be via fulfillment of your duty. You might note that duty does not require hope as an input condition. Hope versus despair, or hopefulness versus hopelessness are things that duty does not need to be bothered about. 

Duty towards what, you ask? Or more fundamentally, what is the meaning of the word "duty", for a human being such as you or me? 

Hmm... I wonder if there can be any sliver of genuine hope, for a human being to obtain the most authentic and legitimate description of the duty one is meant to fulfill, and to then be able to conscientiously follow through, with that duty? 

Supposedly, as soon as one attains the exact duty-bound mindset towards a "true calling", the entire life of such a person becomes readily reconfigured to actualize all the necessary stipulations of that calling. And things like sadness, happiness, hope as well as despair, vanish, for the person who becomes duty-bound within the pursuit of the purpose they were "destined" to serve. 

Is destiny even an actual thing worth believing in? If it is your destiny to not believe in destiny, then your destiny to do so, will be actualized. If your destiny is to remain ambivalent or indifferent about believing in destiny, then your destiny to do so, will be actualized. If your destiny is to believe in that concept, then your destiny to do so will be realized. For, "one is guaranteed to meet their destiny on the path they took to avoid it." 

So, what type of hindrances might exist that prevent a person from being able to recognize their own purpose of existence? And can there be a single, ultimate purpose, that comes to fruition out of a culmination of experiences and pursuits, during an overall lifetime? 

When tangible answers to such abstract questions are attained, they at least, provide relief from basic existential concerns and struggles. 

### Culturally Defined Relationships Among Words 
 
Also, a number of ways of describing "relatedness" among things, exists in linguistics, where the part-whole or abstract-tangible relationship between things being taken into consideration, need not be due to inclusion of one thing within another thing, based on formulae that can be derived from known corollaries and principles. Nor do they need to be derived from any empirically verifiable laws contained in an up-to-date compendium of physical sciences. These ways include: 

- [Hyponymy and Hypernymy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponymy_and_hypernymy), which describes the identifiable sub-types or sub-groups called "hyponyms", that are conventionally associated with an identifiable type or group called the "hypernym", within the culturally popular lexicon used by a speech community. The sub-type or sub-group is usually a specific instance, or a particular example, of a generic type of a thing. Hyponyms and Hypernyms that exist in one language, might not exist in another, for anthropological reasons. 

- [Meronymy and Holonymy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meronymy_and_holonymy), which describe the physical entities that join or assemble together as parts, to form a physically whole item. 

    - For example: Within belief systems of some cultures, soul is a part of all animate beings including plants and animals, while in some others, a soul is only a part of human beings; and in other cultures, the idea of a soul or "an essence", does not exist, for it cannot exist in any contiguous part of the universe. Explaining why a soul does or does not exist in a portion of the universe, is indeed difficult. So, believing that either every part of the universe has a soul as well as a purpose from a teleological perspective, or that none of the portions of the universe have any type of essence from a nihilistic perspective, might be economic and consistent, based on the simplicity of those types of philosophical perspectives. Will either help you, more or less, in paying your bills and defending your personhood or homestead? The only way to accurately find out which philosophical perspective would be the best one to abide by, would be to live a lifetime having adopted one philosophy and then another lifetime using the other belief system, to then somehow, have the ability to compare the similarities and contrast between those separate lifetimes, from an independent vantage point. All of which, anyways doesn't seem feasible as an endeavor that can be accomplished within the period of one whole lifespan. 

    - As another example: You may ask yourself whether cognition is part of a thing called the mind, or the mind is part of a process called cognition? And if your mind is within your body while your body is within an environment, where then does your mind reside? 

    - The words ascribed to "parts" that naturally constitute a physically identifiable "whole", within a language, need not be unique. That is, the very same word used for identifying an entity that can be a constituent object in one context (such as, fingers of a human hand), can also be used among people who subscribe to a speech community to describe a considerably different thing (such as, chicken fingers, which is the name of a food dish). The actual meaning of the word ascribed to a part or to a whole, is dependent on the context obtained from other portions of speech or text being exchanged by people during a particular conversation or an imprint. 

- [Polysemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysemy) is the existent capacity of a sign, symbol, glyph, morpheme, word, or a phrase to allude to more than one thing. Polysemy is the linguistic property due to which "puns", "innuendos", "analogies", "allegories", "metonyms", and "metaphors" are possible within a language. The intended meaning of a polysemic item is dependent on the context of its usage within a conversation or a publication. 

    - Polysemy describes a "one-to-many" relationship between words-and-meanings. 

- [Synonym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym): A number of differently articulated words that happen to have exactly the same, or approximately the same meaning. For example, the words "imprint" and "publication" were used as synonyms, in the above paragraphs. 

    - Synonyms describe a "many-to-one" relationship between words-and-meanings. 

- [Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption). One might think that encryption is only possible due to the intrinsic property of things in this universe, which lends to them being used as substitutes for each other via algebra, during the process of conveying meaning using a shared "dictionary", of "signal-meaning bindings", shared between a sender and a receiver through an ecology. At least, I think so. 

    - The idea that natural erosion of signal strength along space and time is in itself a process by which things get encrypted, is also included within [theories and models of communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Models_of_communication), especially in theories and models that are more mathematically oriented towards cryptography and cryptanalysis. 

<br>

You may have, or will eventually come to appreciate that, describing human thoughts and articulations is difficult because of the ambiguity intrinsic to communications that include: noisy communication channels; cultural and individual differences; polysemous words; synonyms; non-standard punctuation; slang phrases; dense jargon; esoteric references; rhetorical devices; and encrypted verbiage. 

Now, consider the difficulty in deciphering an intercepted communication being publicly, or privately exchanged between people who are multi-cultural polyglots, and who happen to use a mash-up of words from foreign sounding languages, along with "insider meanings" ascribed to those words based on a non-mainstream "sub-culture", whereby, those meanings are only comprehensible to members of the niche group of people who frequently use those words and phrases, within a particular sociological setting. 

Then comes the difficulty of "understanding the proper context" of a set of messages that were, or are being exchanged publicly, or privately, among a group of people belonging to a sub-culture; wherein, the messages include multi-stable meanings that were, or are being (mis)communicated, asymmetrically and asynchronously, through different modalities, such as: in-person speech and gestures, telephonic communications, graffiti, and relayed messages via human or machine based proxies. 

Even if the intended purpose of a communication is to publicize it widely, with no forms of secrecy, and no forms of hidden or double meanings incorporated within that communication, the likelihood that its contents will become popular or widely used as "common knowledge", is entirely probabilistic. So one of the main chores to be accomplished by scholars of a field of study, is to at least describe the state-of-the-art within a chosen area of exploration, via publications, to any entrant or future member of a formal society who may be, or may become, interested in that area of study and practice. In doing so, one can perhaps, promote the knowledge and wisdom obtained from laborious expeditions and experiments, and can make them accessible to the public, in the name of achieving a greater good for humanity, through the use of publicly affordable educational systems. 

### Modern Approach to Classification and Categorization of Things

"Knowledge discovery and representation" might be the only viable activity that an intelligent being can possibly commit to. It might also be the only earnest activity that a cognitive being is supposed to consciously achieve, at any point in its existence. 

Of course, the very act of discovering and representing worthwhile knowledge, is in itself useful, for discovering and representing worthwhile knowledge. 

One might immediately think about the entire body of [work produced by Emmanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant#Philosophy), and that of [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann), in describing formal methods that can be adopted for collecting observations, and for arriving at judgments via rigorous styles of reasoning, to represent the necessary concepts and ideas gained as knowledge from that type of formalism. So, ample literature and sets of examples exist, for how to "properly" discover, store, and work upon materials and ideas gained from the natural world. 

In every era of human history since the Bronze Age, within every conceivable civilization, formal education appears to have been mostly about learning to avoid imbalance, unfair judgments, disturbances, fallacies, and mistakes while doing something "measurably good." Perhaps the only distinction that modern educational systems have arrived upon, compared to medieval and pre-industrial era ones, has to do with "economic affordability of, and equitable opportunities via, formal education and scholarship." 

>The question of economic affordability and equitable opportunities, in the context of human rights and civil liberties, is simply this: "How much of the taxes, excise duties, stamp duties, tributes, homage, tariffs, tolls, fees, and any other forms of tithe or 'donations', collected from the public, by any organization, are to be veritably allocated towards the health, housing, education, and training of people, from whom those monies were collected in the first place?" 

In most modern countries that are industrialized or are currently industrializing, public-funds are usually utilized for, creating and distributing quality goods and services to the public within a jurisdiction, supplied by corporate entities that are "publicly accountable" to all the people living in said jurisdiction, without disenfranchising any select groups of people in an unfair, discriminatory, or prejudiced manner. I say usually, because too often, various portions of public-funds are not utilized appropriately for public goods and services, and are instead squandered or siphoned by the activities of incompetent or conniving public service units,[^1] regardless of the country in question. And indeed, various groups of innocent people are deliberately disenfranchised in a targeted and discriminatory way by those bad public service agencies, in quite a few regional municipalities of various countries. The only comfort some people might have in the wake of such realities, is by cajoling themselves about how a few noteworthy members of their municipality, or state, or their federal government, are not as incompetent or corrupt, as some other ones.   

It can be observed that too often, the worst forms of wastage and disastrous mismanagement tend to occur in large-scale infrastructure projects that somehow require, lots of "lubrication for the wheels" of various government bodies. For instance, when have you ever heard or read about, modern public infrastructure projects related to transportation, water, housing, or heavy industry sectors of an economy, that have been completed within the estimated time and financial budget, as per publicly espoused and stipulated quality standards, in any conceivable country? 

So the topic of preventing gross mismanagement of industrial projects, is at the very forefront of industrial and systems engineering courses, in most universities of the world that have legitimate engineering colleges. In fact, almost all of the topics covered in subjects like: engineering economics, actuarial science, operations research, human factors and ergonomics, business development and industrial production planning, are ultimately geared towards the ethical practice of "risk mitigation, and risk management." 

So, can you imagine a university program about entrepreneurship, that simply never even talks about physical and legal risk management and mitigation, in the context of new venture creation, but instead prods students to take incalculable personal risks in "pursuing their dreams with passion?" Can you then imagine any school forcibly pushing people to believe that they can attain the "frontier spirit" needed to be an entrepreneur, *only* by haphazardly following their goals or visions, through Neo-liberal capitalist philosophies about financial growth and development. Then, imagine a school where, through even more cunning methods, once students have been baited through false advertising and misleading endorsements to attend the program about entrepreneurship, a convenient "bait and switch" tactic is deployed for teaching something called "intraprenurship" to the snared students, instead of entrepreneurship or a regular business-school curriculum. 

Yes, those types of bad university programs that rip-off international and local students, still continue to exist in places like Ontario, Canada[^2], but I've digressed quite a bit from the main topic of this article.  

Coming back to the topic of "tracing the history of formal methods in knowledge discovery and representation", especially for risk management, innovative technology development, and new venture creation: 

> A 2-dimensional "abstraction - decomposition space, of concepts", known as an "Abstraction Hierarchy", was proposed by Jens Rasmussen, and Kim Vicente (1994).[^3] Its main purpose at the time, was to describe the total-quality management of an electrical power generation plant, such as a nuclear power plant, to people in engineering and managerial positions who would need to safely commission and operate a power plant. 

A nuclear power plant accidentally blowing up and polluting a region of the world, is a notable and remarkably expensive tragedy, for people living far away from that kind of an industrial disaster. For people who suffer and die in its fallout, the story is not something victims get to pragmatically reflect upon, due to the terminating condition known as death. So figuring out how to harness nuclear energy in an economic and safe way, is obviously worthwhile because handling all other sources of fossil fuels for electrification has already reached "peak pollution", in various parts of the world. 

What is peak pollution, you ask? Instead of thinking about "peak oil", or "peak coal", one needs to think about a geological region's capacity to replenish its environmental health without becoming saturated to the point of *peak pollution,* whereby it is practically degraded to the point of not being fit for human habitation or for sustaining biodiversity, ever again in the foreseeable future. 

For example, it turns out that, all of the Mediterranean Sea has reached a point that is way past peak pollution, because almost no form of coral can live at its seabed, and the marine life that can be commercially obtained from it, isn't particularly healthy for human consumption. Even though the Mediterranean Sea has become saturated with toxic pollutants to an extent that is irreversible in the coming two centuries, more number of oil and gas excavation sites have already been planned and are being put into operation, around Cyprus, which will only pollute the sea further, from its undue exploitation and improper usage. Oh! And not to mention the wars that will be fought in the region around the Black Sea, Aegean, and the Mediterranean, for the sake of grabbing mineral and fossil fuel resources. 

So, did somebody forget to implement, or did somebody deliberately get rid of environmental protection standards that would have been stipulated by government workers, engineers, and managers dealing with fossil fuel based industrial projects, in regions surrounding water bodies like the Mediterranean Sea, using tools like the Abstraction Hierarchy? 

The Abstraction Hierarchy isn't the only one of its kind, in terms of a tool or a technique that can be useful in discovering necessary data-types, goals, policies, and programmable processes for implementing large, multinational industrial-scale projects. There are many other project management tools and techniques that use things like [Unified Modeling Language (UML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language#Design) for project creation, operations management, and quality control. It's just that, too often, the ethical standards and guiding principles needed to be codified and practiced via the same set of documentation as all other blue-prints of a project, get sidelined and relegated to some other set of documentation created by a poorly funded team concerned with "ESG Factors" (Environmental, Social, and Government Factors.) 

All the forms of rhyme and reason, provided using any type of presentation, still cannot make greedy, sly, and belligerent people budge on the topic for adopting a better definition of "profit", that isn't only contingent on the notion of short-term financial returns. Also, there aren't going to be sufficiently many strong and fair-minded jurists, lawyers, doctors, managers, engineers, designers, technicians, logicians, or any type of artists, who will ever be concerned about preservation and improvement of ecological wealth in a manner that can be enjoyed by successive generations of human beings, as long as there are schools and colleges that teach students to adopt `"gray-area tactics" and "Blue-Ocean Strategies", to produce "Unicorns" out of "Blue-Sky Projects",` which invariably only cater to the whims of the ultra-rich. 

Has there ever been a shortage of saints, sages, high priests, astute grand masters, honest researchers, skilled crafts people, noble laureates, smart martial commanders, maverick athletes, brilliant marketers, suave sales people, and "learned" bureaucrats in the world? No, not really. And yet, the number of unpolluted habitable regions in the world, with a healthy and sustainable natural ecology, has continued to rapidly dwindle. Why? Isn't a single one of those people capable of prioritizing and valuing non-polluting activities of "living to the fullest", over other activities? 

In the pursuit of virtuosity and happiness via "good" deeds, how do people manage to completely overlook ecological degradation in various parts of the world and in their own cities, as an output of their so-called rightful pursuits?
