### The Riddle's Purpose
The above riddle is posed to instill into a reader, the feeling or emotion of "being curious."   

Curiosity is the essence and basis of exploration, discovery and innovation.
Without any sense of wanting or needing to know an answer, the question pertaining to the answer remains unwarranted.
So congratulations to you if you were able to attain the riddle's answer by yourself, solely through your contemplative efforts.
Congratulations even if you had to refer to the answer and then, did or did not feel satisfied with it.
Even in the case where you have an answer that you are not going to verify with the given link, and are otherwise satisfied, congratulations!

Putting aside the time and effort you invested in resolving or trying to resolve the riddle, was it even worth attempting to do so?

Could you have evaluated the value of the riddle or question or problem, without even comprehending it? 
Without even trying to guess at its answer even once?

These further questions were posed for discussing the importance of valuable formal methods in cybernetics.
And just before we dwell into those methods, here is one final, quintessential question:

> What is indeed many when it is two or more, but the same as none when it is one? 

If you already obtained *the* answer to that question then being asked the very same question again and again is merely to highlight the loss of a sense of inquisitiveness once you *know* the answer.

The riddle or question may now seem banal or mundane and yet, it serves a further purpose.
It can now be used to provide the essence of banality and that of a trite trivia, without ever lessening the value of its answer.
